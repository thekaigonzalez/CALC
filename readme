my html calculator (v1.0.0)

allows multiple length numbers
only supports + and -
press the equal sign to get your result.

0-9 are supported (those are hopefully the only numbers you'll need...)

note:

        the clear button is also the equal sign. this was not intended, but that
        is how it's designed. please don't kill me.
